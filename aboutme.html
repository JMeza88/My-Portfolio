	<h1> Get to know me</h1>
	<p>An enthusiast of digital advertising with expertise in the newspaper and media industry. I have developed extensive knowledge behind a product development lifecycle with the primary focus of bringing these ad products to life digitally. 
	</p>

	<p>
	My next goal is trying to increase my knowledge around HTML, CSS and JS in order to properly input on projects from a developers perspective. Both in helping outline timeslines and updating code bases.

		Born and raised in NYC, growing up I always had a fasination with technology. It wasn't until I studied at Baruch college where my interest in marketing/advertising started to develop. My only issue was always how to combine my two interests into a 9-5 that will always interest me. Working at the NY Times has opened me up to that exact possiblity in the ad tech field.
